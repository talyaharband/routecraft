# Israeli Address Autocomplete

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Address Components
Israeli address format: `[Street Name] [Number], [City], [Postal Code]`
Hebrew: `[rechov] [mispar], [ir], [mikud]`

Example: rechov Rothschild 42, Tel Aviv-Yafo, 6688312

### Step 2: Validate Components
1. **City:** Check against CBS official settlement list (~1,300 entries)
2. **Street:** Verify street exists in the city (data.gov.il street database)
3. **Number:** Validate format (number, optional apartment/entrance)
4. **Postal code:** 7 digits, verify matches the address area

### Step 3: Lookup Missing Data
- **No postal code:** Look up via Israel Post website or reference data
- **No city code:** Look up in CBS settlement code table
- **No street:** Suggest closest matching streets in the city

### Step 4: Format Output
Provide address in:
- Hebrew (official format)
- English transliteration
- Structured data (JSON with components separated)

## Bundled Resources

### Scripts
- `scripts/lookup_address.py` — Look up CBS city codes, parse and format Israeli addresses into structured components, and list all known cities with their codes and area codes. Supports subcommands: `city`, `format`, `cities`. Run: `python scripts/lookup_address.py --help`

### References
- `references/city-codes.md` — CBS settlement codes for the top 30 Israeli cities by population, including district, Hebrew transliteration, and telephone area codes. Also covers the 7-digit postal code (mikud) format and standard address structure. Consult when resolving city names to CBS codes or validating address components.

## Gotchas
- Israeli street names exist in both Hebrew and Arabic, with different official spellings. Agents may use only the Hebrew name, missing valid Arabic variants that appear on government documents.
- Israeli city names have multiple valid transliterations (e.g., "Tel Aviv" vs "Tel-Aviv" vs "Tel Aviw"). Agents should normalize inputs before matching.
- Settlement and neighborhood boundaries in Israel are politically sensitive. Agents should avoid making assumptions about municipal boundaries, especially for areas in the West Bank or Golan Heights.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Street not found"
Cause: Spelling variation or renamed street
Solution: Try common transliteration variants. Many streets have Hebrew-only official names.

### Error: "Postal code not matching address area"
Cause: Israel Post periodically updates mikud codes, especially in new developments
Solution: Use the current Israel Post API or CBS settlement file for up-to-date postal codes. New neighborhoods may have different mikud codes than their parent city.

### Error: "City name ambiguity"
Cause: Multiple Israeli settlements share similar names (e.g., Kfar Saba vs Kfar Sava, Ramat Gan vs Ramat HaSharon)
Solution: Use CBS settlement code for unambiguous identification. Present the user with a list of matching settlements with their codes and district for disambiguation.
